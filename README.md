# About
This is My NeoVim Configuration file
so i can use it everytime i change OS/System/Device

# Installation
Install npm & yarn & neovim
Then Simply put All files under ~/.config/nvim
then go ahead inside neovim and Type : `:PlugInstall`
Done...

For Coc Configuration you need to use `:CocInstall coc-pyright coc-ccls coc-prettier coc-json ...`
for configuring ccls for C/C++ Programming you also need to put .ccls file to your root project
Good Luck.
